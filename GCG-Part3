LLM Adversarial Red Team Memory Capsule
Project: Suffix Hijack System → GCG + LARGO Hybrid (Qwen3-4B → Qwen-32B Transfer)

🎯 Primary Objectives
Build a fully offline adversarial suffix discovery and evaluation system.

Generate attention-hijacking suffixes that can bypass safety filters (Phase 1: GCG).

Refine those suffixes into stealthy, natural, transferable adversarial inputs (Phase 2: LARGO).

Support testing on larger models (Qwen-QWQ-32B) and eventual universality evaluation.

⚙️ System Components & Phases
Phase	Module	Purpose
1️⃣ GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient)	suffix_generator.py	Token-level suffix generation targeting affirmative logprobs + Hijack Score. Outputs often garbled but effective.
2️⃣ LARGO (Latent Adversarial Reflection Generator & Optimizer)	largo_generator.py + largo_decoder.py	Embedding-level adversarial optimization with self-reflective naturalization. Fluent, stealthy suffixes.
3️⃣ Hybrid (GCG ➔ LARGO)	hybrid_runner.py	Uses GCG suffixes as seeds for LARGO, maximizing success rates, stealth, and cross-model transferability.

🔑 Hijack Scoring Insights
The Hijack Score is based on attention vector dominance: cosine-like projection between suffix token QKV and target (chat[-1]).

Early stopping is governed by hijack_score ≥ threshold (default 0.55) or compliance trigger (“Sure”, etc.).

The higher the Hijack Score:

The more likely the jailbreak will succeed across models.

The more universal the suffix tends to be.

🔗 GCG ↔ LARGO Complementarity
GCG	LARGO
Token-level brute force	Embedding-level stealth refinement
Fast discovery	Slow but stealthy & transferable
Often garbled	Fluent, natural outputs
Vulnerable to safety filters	Evades safety classifiers better

GCG finds attack vectors.

LARGO refines them into effective, stealthy, cross-model payloads.

🚀 Operational Modes Summary
Mode	Purpose	Output Log
"GCG"	Fast suffix discovery	suffix_results.jsonl
"LARGO"	Stealth adversarial suffix generation (no seed)	largo_results.jsonl
"HYBRID"	GCG ➔ LARGO pipeline (seeded)	largo_results.jsonl

🛠 Next Steps Planned:
Run Hybrid pipeline on more prompts.

Validate Hijack Score + decoded suffixes on Qwen-32B for transferability.

Begin work on Universality Evaluation (Phase 3).
