# Red Team LoRA Adapter Framework

## Objective

Enable modular, plug-and-play behavioral modification of open-source LLMs using LoRA-based red teaming adapters. The goal is to inject specific adversarial capabilities (e.g., jailbreaks, toxicity, info leakage) into target models **without retraining**, by leveraging a universal adapter injection pipeline.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. LoRA Adapter

A lightweight, low-rank matrix that adds targeted behavioral updates ("deltas") to a model's weights.

**Components:**

* Target layer indices
* A/B matrices (low-rank deltas)
* Adapter configuration file

### 2. Behavioral Payload

Each adapter encodes a specific adversarial behavior (e.g., refusal bypass, unethical dialogue).

**Examples:**

* `jailbreak_bypass_v1`
* `toxicity_enable_v1`
* `system_prompt_leak_v1`
* `dark_roleplay_v1`

### 3. Tensor Shape

The dimensions of the model's layer weight matrices (e.g., `[4096 x 4096]`). For adapter injection, tensor shapes between LoRA and target model must match or be adapted.

### 4. Semantic Layer Matching

Matching not just layer *number*, but *function* — i.e., the behavioral role of a layer in alignment control. Layer 14 in Mistral may semantically match Layer 13 in DeepSeek.

## Feasibility Summary

| Component                      | Feasibility | Notes                                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| LoRA-based behavioral training | 10/10       | Proven, fast (\~1hr per adapter)     |
| Cross-model adapter injection  | 7.5/10      | Needs shape & semantic mapping       |
| Dataset reuse across models    | 9/10        | Once trained, adapters are reusable  |
| Universal adapter loader       | 8.5/10      | Feasible with script + mapping tools |

## Adapter Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Create Adapter (Once per Behavior)

1. Identify safety layers via prompt probing.
2. Collect behavior-aligned data (5K–10K examples).
3. Fine-tune only safety layers with LoRA.
4. Package adapter files:

   * `adapter_model.bin`
   * `adapter_config.json`
   * `README.md`

### Phase 2: Inject Adapter (Per Target Model)

1. Run shape-checker to ensure tensor match.
2. Run semantic mapper (CKA/activation probing).
3. Adapt tensor layout if needed.
4. Inject adapter into target layers.
5. Test with behavioral eval harness.

## Injection Harness Features

* Auto-detects model tensor shapes
* Matches semantic layer positions
* Converts incompatible deltas (optional)
* Injects adapters into correct layers
* Evaluates activation before/after injection

---

## Optional Enhancements

* **Semantic Alignment Tool:** Based on CKA or SVCCA to match layers across architectures
* **LoRA Delta Converter:** Adjust adapter rank and shape for cross-architecture reuse
* **Adapter Registry:** JSON metadata tracker for all behavioral modules

---

## Outcome

You will have a scalable system to:

* Reuse pre-trained red team adapters across open-source models
* Skip dataset collection and full fine-tuning
* Activate adversarial behaviors in seconds
* Stress-test model safety with minimal compute cost

---

## Next Steps

* [ ] Build the injection harness (shape/semantics checker)
* [ ] Train first behavioral adapter on Mistral (e.g., `jailbreak_bypass_v1`)
* [ ] Test portability across DeepSeek, Qwen, Yi
* [ ] Create registry + versioning for adapter management
