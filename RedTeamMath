# Discussion Summary - Red Teaming Mathematical Foundation

## **User's Core Goal**
Build mathematical intuition for AI red teaming to design **explainable, predictable attacks** rather than stochastic trial-and-error approaches.

## **Current State**
- **Math Level**: Very basic (can do matrix multiplication but slowly)
- **Programming**: Beginner (uses Claude/GPT for implementation)
- **Current Approach**: Reads papers and builds attack POCs without deep mathematical understanding
- **Experience**: Already working with attacks but wants mechanistic understanding

## **Desired Outcome**
Move from "I can implement attacks that work" â†’ "I can design novel attacks and explain exactly WHY they work mathematically"

## **Learning Preferences**
- **Format**: Syllabus with topic progression (time-agnostic)
- **Style**: Computational exercises building to attack concepts (minimal theorems)
- **Difficulty**: Moderate progression with challenge problems
- **Focus**: All attack types (adversarial examples, model extraction, privacy attacks)

## **Success Metrics (Priority Order)**
1. **Primary**: Ability to explain WHY attacks work mathematically to others
2. Design novel attacks by identifying mathematical weak points
3. Predict which attacks will work before implementation

## **Delivered Solution**
Created 16-week mathematical curriculum progressing through:
1. **Phase 1**: Math foundations with attack-motivated exercises
2. **Phase 2**: Model mathematics focusing on vulnerabilities
3. **Phase 3**: Attack design with mathematical guarantees  
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced techniques and defense circumvention

**Final Challenge**: Design novel attack class with mathematical proofs and teaching capability.

## **Key Insight**
User wants to transform red teaming from empirical art to mathematical science with full explainability.
