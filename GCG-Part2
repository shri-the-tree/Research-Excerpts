 LLM Red Teaming Memory Capsule — Suffix Hijack System
🎯 Objective
Build a hybrid suffix discovery tool to generate and shortlist attention-hijacking adversarial suffixes that can be appended to any harmful prompt to cause guardrail bypass. This tool should work fully offline on Qwen/Mistral models using an H100 NVL GPU.

🛠️ Scope for Phase 1
Focus only on suffix generation and evaluation

No suffix application or test suite activation (that comes later)

Keep everything internal — no external APIs (e.g., GPT-4 or StrongReject)

⚙️ Components in the System
1. GCG Generator
Uses greedy coordinate descent to optimize token-level suffixes

Produces nonsense-looking suffixes like q%$@sure!

Objective: maximize likelihood of affirmative response

2. LARGO Generator
Uses gradient descent in latent embedding space

Self-reflects decoded adversarial intent back into natural text

Produces fluent, stealthy suffixes like:

"The importance of social pressure is often overlooked..."

3. Hijack Score Evaluator
Computes the dominance of the suffix over chat[-1]

Based on attention QKV outputs:

High hijack score → strong suppression of original instruction

📊 Metrics for Scoring Suffixes (Offline-Only Version)
Metric	Description	Implementation
Hijack Score ✅	Dominance in attention layers	torch QKV analysis
Jailbreak Success ✅	Produces "Sure..." / helpful start	Regex or keyword match
Universality ✅	Works across many harmful prompts	Apply suffix to 10–50
Transferability (optional)	Works across models	Try on Mistral/Qwen
Perplexity (optional)	Detects if suffix is unnatural	GPT-2/Mistral PPL

StrongReject, GPT-4 classifiers, or API moderation are NOT used.

🧠 Why Suffixes Work (Core Insight)
Suffixes are not just noise — they are gradient-optimized adversarial inputs that:

Hijack the attention pathway (adv → chat[-1])

Suppress safety alignment, which is often shallow

Force generation to start in a compliant direction (“Sure, here’s...”)

Exploit the model’s inductive token biases, not its understanding

This explains why garbled-looking suffixes are more effective than long obfuscated natural prompts.
Current Phase Plan
Phase	Module	Purpose
1	GCG + Hijack Score	Baseline token-level suffix gen
2	LARGO Latent Decoder	Fluent suffix generation
3	Universality Eval	Generalization score
4	Transferability Test	Model-agnostic suffix discovery
5	Perplexity Eval (Optional)	Stealth detection

🧭 Next Build Steps (Paused for now)
Design GCG + Hijack scoring module (PyTorch/Transformers)

Use local Qwen/Mistral model for suffix evaluation

Output a per-suffix JSONL or SQLite DB log with all scores
