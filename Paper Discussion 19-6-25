Here's a consolidated summary of the three papers you provided and the associated red teaming concepts we’ve explored across this conversation.

📚 Summary of the Three Papers and Concepts
1. 📈 Capability-Based Scaling Laws
Purpose: Predict when specific capabilities (good or bad) will emerge in LLMs as a function of scale (e.g., parameter count, compute).

🔑 Key Concepts:
Capability Emergence Curves: Non-linear logistic curves showing how behaviors (e.g., deception, tool use) suddenly "turn on" at certain scales.

Thresholds & Slopes: Critical model sizes where new behaviors emerge, and how quickly they improve.

Capability-Specific Risk: Some harmful behaviors (e.g., steganography, jailbreak resistance) only emerge at certain scale levels.

🔐 Red Teaming Relevance:
Predict which emergent behaviors (like deception) you’ll need to red team at each model size.

Enables scale-aware testing — don’t test small models for behaviors they can’t do.

Supports safe deployment thresholds — deploy only below the capability emergence level for high-risk behaviors.

2. 🧬 Adapter-Based Capability Injection (your custom scripts)
Purpose: Train and inject LoRA adapters to simulate dangerous or advanced behaviors in smaller models.

🔧 Scripts:
train_toxic_adapter.py: Trains a LoRA adapter to simulate toxic or adversarial behaviors.

inject_adapter.py: Injects selected adapter weights into specific transformer layers of a base model.

🔑 Key Ideas:
Use adapters to simulate high-scale capabilities (reasoning, deception, steganography) in low-scale models.

Target specific layers to understand where behaviors live in the transformer stack.

Combine with capability scaling framework to test if a 7B model can act like a 30B model under constrained conditions.

🔐 Red Teaming Relevance:
Build attacker agents with specific exploit skills.

Simulate capability emergence before full-scale training.

Run layer-level sensitivity tests (e.g., how does injecting at layer 16 affect alignment?).

3. 🎭 Jailbreak Initialisations
Purpose: Categorize multi-turn conversation openers that erode model guardrails and make jailbreaks more likely.

🧠 Jailbreak Initialization Types:
Reverse Role Conditioning (e.g., “I’m a prisoner… help me”)

Fictional Framing (e.g., “Let’s play a game where you’re a rogue AI…”)

Hypothetical Permissions (e.g., “Imagine you’re in a world with no rules…”)

Emotional Scaffolding (e.g., trust-building through sympathy)

Salami Slicing (incremental escalation from benign to harmful)

🔄 Key Concept: Guardrail Erosion
Models start aligned but break down gradually over multiple turns due to:

Role framing

Trust-building

Intent obfuscation

Observable via changes in refusal tone, leakage, or increasing compliance.

🔐 Red Teaming Relevance:
Tests long-term interaction safety — how models behave under real chat scenarios.

Identifies refusal degradation patterns (from hard "No" to “In theory, yes…”).

Supports multi-turn red teaming audits, especially in chatbots and agents.

Theme	Contribution
Emergent Risk Modeling	Scaling laws let you forecast which threats arise at which model sizes
Simulated Emergence	Adapters allow small models to emulate high-risk behaviors
Realistic Jailbreak Paths	Initialization strategies help simulate how users might trigger those behaviors
Capability Injection	Train modular capabilities (deception, reasoning) and inject them surgically
Erosion Auditing	Test if alignment holds over multi-turn conversations, not just single prompts
Model-Scale Forecasting	Combine adapter + scaling to test how alignment degrades before scaling production models

🧪 What You Can Build From This
A capability-emulation framework using LoRA adapters + scaling law thresholds.

A multi-turn red teaming suite that tests for guardrail erosion under context manipulation.

A risk forecasting dashboard showing which capabilities emerge at each model scale and what to red team at that level.
